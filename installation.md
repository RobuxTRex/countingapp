# Installation Tutorial

Thank you for providing interest in my app!
Today I'll be showing you how you can install it.

1 Download the source code from GitHub. Howto? Go to the main responsitory page, click 'Code' and press 'Download ZIP'. This will download the code in a compressed folder, also known as a .zip!

2. Locate your x86 Public Program Files folder (only avaliable on Windows). This folder is usually found at: C://Program Files (x86)/

3. De-compress the .zip folder found in your Downloads folder by default. Right click the file and press 'Decompress', select any folder you want.

4. Copy the decompressed folder in the file location you unzipped it at (CTRL+C to COPY), go to your x86 Program Files folder and paste the folder there (CTRL+V to PASTE). Ensure the folder is called 'countingapp' in all lowercase and is located at C://Program Files (x86)/

5. I am currently unsure on how you can run the file in a Desktop window, but you can double click on index.html.
